# U-ey-

Our app, U-ey, is a productivity app designed for college students who struggle with time management. On the first run, 
users will see a default pie chart recommending a healthy time distribution. This time distribution includes activties such as sleeping,
studying, etc,. Both pie charts can be changed on click, where the bottom pie chart represents the user's desired lifestyle and the 
top pie chart is the user's actual time distribution. There is also a location page that tracks the user's location and how long 
they've been there, which serves as a guide to allow the user to track their time accordingly. Of course, there are buttons to help the 
user navigate between beautifully designed pages.

In order to run the program on your computer, download the "EC327 Project" file and extract the files from the zip. 
Open up Android Studio and select the extracted file to run. 

Ensure that either there is a physical Android device connected when you run it, or choose an emulator that has Google play services 
capability. If there is no map displayed on the locations page, ensure that you have Google play services installed in the SDK manager
(SDK Manager > SDK Tools > Google play services).

In the app, click on either of the pie charts to change the name of the activity and the hours spent on that activity. 
Make sure you click confirm before going back!

Use the sync button when you've had a good time distribution one day and want to make it your new desired lifestyle. 
This will make the bottom chart the same so that you may keep the information for the future.

Click the location page to find out where you've been for the past 8 hours, and give it a name so you can track your time accordingly. 
Make sure to save this name!

Happy tracking! :)
